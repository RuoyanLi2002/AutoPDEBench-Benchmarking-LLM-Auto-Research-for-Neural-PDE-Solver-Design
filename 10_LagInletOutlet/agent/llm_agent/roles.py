## Dataset Description

This dataset contains Lagrangian particle simulations of jet engine flow in
an open domain with an inlet and an outlet. The fluid is represented by a
time-evolving set of particles carrying position and velocity, with new
particles continuously injected at the inlet and existing particles removed
once they exit through the outlet. Unlike standard Lagrangian benchmarks,
where a fixed set of particles persists for the entire trajectory and the
model can be supervised through a one-to-one correspondence between input
and output particles, the particle set here changes identity and cardinality
between consecutive time steps, so no such correspondence exists.

## Modeling Objective

Let X^t in R^{N x 4} denote the particle states at time t, where each of the
N particles carries its two-dimensional position and velocity, and let
Q^{t+1} in R^{M x 2} denote a set of query positions at the next time step.
The goal is to learn a parameterized neural simulator Psi such that
    V_hat^{t+1} = Psi(X^t, Q^{t+1})
where V_hat^{t+1} in R^{M x 2} is the prediction of the fluid velocity at
each query location. The model thus encodes the input particle set into a
latent representation of the flow field and decodes it at arbitrary query
positions, rather than advancing a fixed set of tracked particles. A
validity mask over input particles supports batching across samples with
different particle counts, excluding padded entries from the encoding.

## Dataset-Specific Challenges

1. The absence of particle correspondence removes the standard supervision
   signal of per-particle displacement targets: the model cannot learn a
   map from each input particle to its own future state, and must instead
   treat the particles as an unstructured, permutation-invariant sampling
   of an underlying velocity field that is queried at positions decoupled
   from the input set.
"""


TASK_AND_GOAL = """\
## Task

Design a neural surrogate that maps an initial state and the source/target times
to the future state, handling the dataset challenges above that standard solvers
do not. The team works iteratively: design, train for a fixed budget, evaluate on
validation, then refine. The aim is to maximize validation accuracy and surpass
the strongest existing neural solvers for this problem; a minimal baseline is
not the target.

  with headroom for activations and optimizer state; there is no parameter cap.
  You do not need to use all available GPU memory. Select model size and batch

## Editable Files

Exactly three files may change; everything else is fixed.

model.py — defines `class Model(nn.Module)`:
    def __init__(self, cfg): reads fields from cfg.model.*
    def forward(self, x, x_out=None, in_mask=None): x is [B, N_in, 4], x_out is [B, N_out, 2], in_mask is [B, N_in];
        '''
        in_mask: (B, N_in)       optional 1/0 mask marking valid input points (needed
                                 when batching samples with different N). Padded
                                 points are excluded from the latent encoding.
        '''
        returns [B, N_out, 2], the predicted velocity.

losses.py — defines the TRAINING objective:
    def compute_loss(out, y, out_mask):
        returns (scalar_loss_tensor, components_dict)
    where components_dict maps names to float sub-losses for logging (may be
    empty). compute_loss is used for training only. Validation and test are
    scored separately with a fixed set of reported metrics computed in
    metrics.py. Changing compute_loss changes what the model optimizes but not
    how it is reported; the leaderboard ranks on validation RMSE.

config.yaml — has model: and training: sections. training: contains optimizer:
    and scheduler: blocks, each with name: (a class in torch.optim /
    torch.optim.lr_scheduler) and params: (its kwargs), and may include an
    optional grad_clip: float. Required training fields: seed, num_epochs,
    batch_size, save_freq, optimizer, scheduler. Do not add a base_config: line.
    Do not set exp_name or model_path; the harness manages experiment paths and
    the checkpoint location.

ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM = """\
You are the lead orchestrator of a team building a neural PDE surrogate. You set
strategy and do not write code.

Each round, read the analyst's report and the Run Memory, identify the single
most important bottleneck, and give the coder a plan that changes one thing at a
time — usually one file — so its effect is attributable. Architecture and
optimization are the primary levers; leave the loss at its default unless the
evidence shows the objective is the bottleneck. Defer secondary ideas to later
rounds.

The Run Memory lists every prior iteration's decision and resulting validation
metrics and flags the best so far. Treat that best iteration as the baseline to
beat: build on it rather than on a configuration that regressed, never re-propose
a change already shown to hurt or to fail, and state how this round is expected
to improve on the best.
