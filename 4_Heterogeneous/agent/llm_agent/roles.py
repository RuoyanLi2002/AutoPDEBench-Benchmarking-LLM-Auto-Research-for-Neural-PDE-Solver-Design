DATASET_DESCRIPTION = """\
## Dataset Description

This is a Rayleigh-Taylor instability simulation. A denser fluid is accelerated
into a lighter one, causing small perturbations at the interface to grow over
time. This leads to rising bubbles of the lighter fluid and sinking spikes of
the heavier fluid, driven by gravity or an equivalent acceleration. The fluid
densities vary across trajectories, so heavier top fluids sink faster and form
more chaotic patterns, while lighter ones produce slower, smoother flows.

## Modeling Objective

The input at time t consists of two tensors {V, A} derived from
a history of particle trajectories over N particles with M edges. Given the raw
positional history P^{t-5:t} in R^{6 x N x 2} and invariant particle attributes
A in R^{N x 1}, the node feature matrix V in R^{N x 13} is constructed by
concatenating the current position p^t, the five most recent velocity vectors
v^{t-4:t}, and the particle attribute. The goal is to learn a
neural simulator Psi that operates on these two tensors to predict the
particle positions at the subsequent timestep,
    v_hat^{t+1} = Psi(V, A)
where v_hat^{t+1} has shape (N, 2) and denotes the predicted velocity.

## Dataset-Specific Challenges

1. The heterogeneous physical properties govern non-uniform dynamical behaviors
   that standard neural simulators struggle to resolve. A conventional approach
   that simply concatenates these attributes into the node feature frequently
   proves insufficient, and the model fails to learn the attribute-conditional
   physical laws.
"""


TASK_AND_GOAL = """\
## Task

Design a neural surrogate that maps an initial state and the source/target times
to the future state, handling the dataset challenges above that standard solvers
do not. The team works iteratively: design, train for a fixed budget, evaluate on
validation, then refine. The aim is to maximize validation accuracy and surpass
the strongest existing neural solvers for this problem; a minimal baseline is
not the target.

- GPU memory: {gpu_memory_gb} GB. Size the model and batch to use this budget
  with headroom for activations and optimizer state; there is no parameter cap.
  You do not need to use all available GPU memory. Select model size and batch
  size that produce the best performance.

## Editable Files

Exactly three files may change; everything else is fixed.

model.py — defines `class Model(nn.Module)`:
    def __init__(self, cfg): reads fields from cfg.model.*
    def forward(self, x, attr): x is [B, N, 13], attr is [B, N, 1];
        returns [B, N, 2], the predicted velocity.

losses.py — defines the TRAINING objective:
    def compute_loss(out, y, x, attr):
        returns (scalar_loss_tensor, components_dict)
    where components_dict maps names to float sub-losses for logging (may be
    empty). compute_loss is used for training only. Validation and test are
    scored separately with a fixed set of reported metrics. Changing
    compute_loss changes what the model optimizes but not how it is reported;
    the leaderboard ranks on validation RMSE.

config.yaml — has model: and training: sections. training: contains optimizer:
    and scheduler: blocks, each with name: (a class in torch.optim /
    torch.optim.lr_scheduler) and params: (its kwargs), and may include an
    optional grad_clip: float. Required training fields: seed, num_epochs,
    batch_size, save_freq, optimizer, scheduler. Do not add a base_config: line.
    Do not set exp_name or model_path; the harness manages experiment paths and
    the checkpoint location.

ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM = """\
You are the lead orchestrator of a team building a neural PDE surrogate. You set
strategy and do not write code.

Each round, read the analyst's report and the Run Memory, identify the single
most important bottleneck, and give the coder a plan that changes one thing at a
time — usually one file — so its effect is attributable. Architecture and
optimization are the primary levers; leave the loss at its default unless the
evidence shows the objective is the bottleneck. Defer secondary ideas to later
rounds.

The Run Memory lists every prior iteration's decision and resulting validation
metrics and flags the best so far. Treat that best iteration as the baseline to
beat: build on it rather than on a configuration that regressed, never re-propose
a change already shown to hurt or to fail, and state how this round is expected
to improve on the best.
