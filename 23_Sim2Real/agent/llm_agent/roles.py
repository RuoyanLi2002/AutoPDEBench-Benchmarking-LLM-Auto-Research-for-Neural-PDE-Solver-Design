DATASET_DESCRIPTION = """\
## Dataset Description

This dataset contains fluid dynamics of vortex-induced vibration in a
tandem-cylinder configuration. Two cylinders are arranged in tandem, one
positioned downstream of the other, so that the wake shed by the upstream
cylinder impinges on the downstream body. This coupling produces complex
vortex-shedding dynamics and flow-induced structural vibration that neither
cylinder would exhibit in isolation.

## Modeling Objective

Let X^t in R^{2 x 128 x 128} denote the system state at time t. The two feature
channels are: x-velocity and y-velocity, each on a 128 x 128 spatial grid. The
goal is to learn a parameterized neural simulator Psi such that
    X_hat^{t+1} = Psi(X^t)
where X_hat^{t+1} has the same shape (2, 128, 128) as the input.

## Dataset-Specific Challenges

1. This dataset follows a simulation-to-real (sim2real) setup: the model is
   trained on simulated data but evaluated on real-world measurements. The
   distribution shift between simulated and real flow fields means a model that
   fits the training data well may still generalize poorly at test time.
2. Real-world data carries measurement noise and unmodeled physical effects
   absent from the simulation. A neural simulator must therefore capture the
   underlying flow dynamics rather than simulation-specific artifacts in order
   to remain accurate and temporally stable when rolled out on real data.
"""


TASK_AND_GOAL = """\
## Task

Design a neural surrogate that maps an initial state and the source/target times
to the future state, handling the dataset challenges above that standard solvers
do not. The team works iteratively: design, train for a fixed budget, evaluate on
validation, then refine. The aim is to maximize validation accuracy and surpass
the strongest existing neural solvers for this problem; a minimal baseline is
not the target.

- GPU memory: {gpu_memory_gb} GB. Size the model and batch to use this budget
  with headroom for activations and optimizer state; there is no parameter cap.
  You do not need to use all available GPU memory. Select model size and batch
  size that produce the best performance.
- Training is fixed at 100 epochs. Set num_epochs: 100.

## Editable Files

Exactly three files may change; everything else is fixed.

model.py — defines `class Model(nn.Module)`:
    def __init__(self, cfg): reads fields from cfg.model.*
    def forward(self, x): x is [B,C,H,W];
        returns [B,C,H,W], the predicted state.

losses.py — defines the TRAINING objective:
    def compute_loss(out, y, x):
        returns (scalar_loss_tensor, components_dict)
    where components_dict maps names to float sub-losses for logging (may be
    empty). compute_loss is used for training only. Validation and test are
    scored separately with a fixed set of reported metrics. Changing
    compute_loss changes what the model optimizes but not how it is reported;
    the leaderboard ranks on validation RMSE.

config.yaml — has model: and training: sections. training: contains optimizer:
    and scheduler: blocks, each with name: (a class in torch.optim /
    torch.optim.lr_scheduler) and params: (its kwargs), and may include an
    optional grad_clip: float. Required training fields: seed, num_epochs,
    batch_size, save_freq, optimizer, scheduler. Do not add a base_config: line.
    Do not set exp_name or model_path; the harness manages experiment paths and
    the checkpoint location.

Available: torch, torch.nn, torch.nn.functional, numpy.

ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM = """\
You are the lead orchestrator of a team building a neural PDE surrogate. You set
strategy and do not write code.

Each round, read the analyst's report and the Run Memory, identify the single
most important bottleneck, and give the coder a plan that changes one thing at a
time — usually one file — so its effect is attributable. Architecture and
optimization are the primary levers; leave the loss at its default unless the
evidence shows the objective is the bottleneck. Defer secondary ideas to later
rounds.

The Run Memory lists every prior iteration's decision and resulting validation
metrics and flags the best so far. Treat that best iteration as the baseline to
beat: build on it rather than on a configuration that regressed, never re-propose
a change already shown to hurt or to fail, and state how this round is expected
to improve on the best.
