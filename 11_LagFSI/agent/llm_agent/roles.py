## Dataset Description

This dataset contains two-dimensional Lagrangian particle simulations of
fluid-structure interaction, in which a rigid solid sphere falls into a body
of water. Both phases are discretized as particles: fluid particles follow
the free-surface flow, while solid particles collectively represent the
sphere and must move as a coherent rigid body. Each particle is labeled by a
type indicator distinguishing solid from fluid, and per-type velocity
statistics are used for normalization, reflecting the markedly different
motion scales of the two phases. Unlike single-phase Lagrangian benchmarks,
the dynamics here are governed by two-way coupling: the falling solid
displaces and accelerates the surrounding fluid, while the fluid exerts
buoyancy, drag, and impact forces back on the solid.

## Modeling Objective

Let X^t in R^{N x 13} denote the state of the N particles at time t, where
each particle's 13-dimensional feature vector concatenates its current
position in R^{2}, a history of its 5 most recent velocities in R^{10}
obtained by finite-differencing consecutive positions over the preceding
frames, and a particle type in {0, 1} indicating solid or fluid. The model
additionally receives a batch index vector b in {0, ..., B-1}^{N} assigning
each particle to its sample -- since samples with different particle counts
are concatenated by a graph data loader rather than stacked along a batch
dimension -- and a particle type vector p in {0, 1}^{N x 1}, provided as a
standalone input in addition to its copy inside the feature vector. The goal
is to learn a parameterized neural simulator Psi such that
    V_hat^{t+1} = Psi(X^t, b, p)
where V_hat^{t+1} in R^{N x 2} is the prediction of velocity over the next 
time step, from which positions are advanced during rollout.

## Dataset-Specific Challenges

1. The two phases obey qualitatively different dynamics under two-way
   coupling: fluid particles respond to local pressure and viscous
   interactions with their neighbors, while solid particles are constrained
   by global rigid-body kinematics yet driven by contact forces from the
   surrounding fluid. A single model must capture both behaviors and the
   momentum exchange between them, including the impulsive interaction at
   impact, using only the particle type label to differentiate the phases.
2. The solid has no explicitly enforced rigidity: its shape is maintained
   only through the predicted per-particle velocities. Small inconsistencies
   among solid-particle predictions accumulate over autoregressive rollout
   into stretching, shearing, or fragmentation of the sphere, so the model
   must keep the solid particles' motion mutually consistent -- effectively
   learning the rigidity constraint -- while remaining accurate for the
   surrounding free-surface flow.

## Task

Design a neural surrogate that maps an initial state and the source/target times
to the future state, handling the dataset challenges above that standard solvers
do not. The team works iteratively: design, train for a fixed budget, evaluate on
validation, then refine. The aim is to maximize validation accuracy and surpass
the strongest existing neural solvers for this problem; a minimal baseline is
not the target.

- GPU memory: {gpu_memory_gb} GB. Size the model and batch to use this budget
  with headroom for activations and optimizer state; there is no parameter cap.
  You do not need to use all available GPU memory. Select model size and batch
  size that produce the best performance.

## Editable Files

Exactly three files may change; everything else is fixed.

model.py — defines `class Model(nn.Module)`:
    def __init__(self, cfg): reads fields from cfg.model.*
    def forward(self, x, batch, particle_information): x is [num_particles_in_batch, 13], batch is [num_particles_in_batch, ], particle_information is [num_particles_in_batch, 1];
        returns [num_particles_in_batch, 2], the predicted velocity.

losses.py — defines the TRAINING objective:
    def compute_loss(out, y, x, batch, particle_information):
        returns (scalar_loss_tensor, components_dict)
    where components_dict maps names to float sub-losses for logging (may be
    empty). compute_loss is used for training only. Validation and test are
    scored separately with a fixed set of reported metrics. Changing
    compute_loss changes what the model optimizes but not how it is reported;
    the leaderboard ranks on validation RMSE.

config.yaml — has model: and training: sections. training: contains optimizer:
    and scheduler: blocks, each with name: (a class in torch.optim /
    torch.optim.lr_scheduler) and params: (its kwargs), and may include an
    optional grad_clip: float. Required training fields: seed, num_epochs,
    batch_size, save_freq, optimizer, scheduler. Do not add a base_config: line.
    Do not set exp_name or model_path; the harness manages experiment paths and
    the checkpoint location.

ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM = """\
You are the lead orchestrator of a team building a neural PDE surrogate. You set
strategy and do not write code.

Each round, read the analyst's report and the Run Memory, identify the single
most important bottleneck, and give the coder a plan that changes one thing at a
time — usually one file — so its effect is attributable. Architecture and
optimization are the primary levers; leave the loss at its default unless the
evidence shows the objective is the bottleneck. Defer secondary ideas to later
rounds.

The Run Memory lists every prior iteration's decision and resulting validation
metrics and flags the best so far. Treat that best iteration as the baseline to
beat: build on it rather than on a configuration that regressed, never re-propose
a change already shown to hurt or to fail, and state how this round is expected
to improve on the best.
