## Dataset Description

This dataset contains fluid dynamics of flow around a cylinder, provided in
three different representations of the same underlying physics: a regular
Eulerian grid, an irregular Eulerian mesh, and Lagrangian particles. Because all
three describe identical dynamics and differ only in how the flow field is
discretized, the aim is to develop a generalized neural solver that can ingest
any one of these representations and produce predictions in that same
representation.

## Modeling Objective

Let X^t in R^{N x 13} denote the system state at time t, where N is the number
of nodes and varies by representation (grid points, mesh points, or Lagrangian
particles). The 13 input features per node are: position (2), a 5-step velocity
history (2 components x 5 steps = 10), and a scalar indicating which
representation the node belongs to (1). The representation scalar is encoded as:
0 for irregular mesh, 1 for regular grid, and 2 or 3 for Lagrangian particles,
where 2 and 3 further distinguish fluid from solid particles. For Lagrangian
particles the position is the particle location at the current step; for the
grid and mesh it is the fixed node position. The goal is to learn a parameterized
neural solver Psi such that
    Y_hat^{t+1} = Psi(X^t)
where Y_hat^{t+1} in R^{N x 2} is the velocity at the next time step for every
node.

## Dataset-Specific Challenges

1. The neural solver must accept all three representations (regular grid,
   irregular mesh, and Lagrangian particles) as input, despite their differing
   node counts, connectivity, and geometric structure. A single model has to
   operate on each without a fixed grid resolution or topology to rely on.
2. The three representations encode the same physics, so the solver must learn a
   consistent set of dynamics from all of them rather than fitting each
   representation independently. Bridging the gap between mesh-based and
   particle-based descriptions of the same flow is the central difficulty.

TASK_AND_GOAL = """\
## Task

Design a neural surrogate that maps an initial state and the source/target times
to the future state, handling the dataset challenges above that standard solvers
do not. The team works iteratively: design, train for a fixed budget, evaluate on
validation, then refine. The aim is to maximize validation accuracy and surpass
the strongest existing neural solvers for this problem; a minimal baseline is
not the target.

  with headroom for activations and optimizer state; there is no parameter cap.
  You do not need to use all available GPU memory. Select model size and batch
  size that produce the best performance.

## Editable Files

Exactly three files may change; everything else is fixed.

model.py — defines `class Model(nn.Module)`:
    def __init__(self, cfg): reads fields from cfg.model.*
    def forward(self, x): x is [B,num_nodes,13];
        returns [B,num_nodes,2], the predicted state.

losses.py — defines the TRAINING objective:
    def compute_loss(out, y, x):
        returns (scalar_loss_tensor, components_dict)
    where components_dict maps names to float sub-losses for logging (may be
    empty). compute_loss is used for training only. Validation and test are
    scored separately with a fixed set of reported metrics. Changing
    compute_loss changes what the model optimizes but not how it is reported;
    the leaderboard ranks on validation RMSE.

config.yaml — has model: and training: sections. training: contains optimizer:
    and scheduler: blocks, each with name: (a class in torch.optim /
    torch.optim.lr_scheduler) and params: (its kwargs), and may include an
    optional grad_clip: float. Required training fields: seed, num_epochs,
    batch_size, save_freq, optimizer, scheduler. Do not add a base_config: line.
    Do not set exp_name or model_path; the harness manages experiment paths and
    the checkpoint location.

ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM = """\
You are the lead orchestrator of a team building a neural PDE surrogate. You set
strategy and do not write code.

Each round, read the analyst's report and the Run Memory, identify the single
most important bottleneck, and give the coder a plan that changes one thing at a
time — usually one file — so its effect is attributable. Architecture and
optimization are the primary levers; leave the loss at its default unless the
evidence shows the objective is the bottleneck. Defer secondary ideas to later
rounds.

The Run Memory lists every prior iteration's decision and resulting validation
metrics and flags the best so far. Treat that best iteration as the baseline to
beat: build on it rather than on a configuration that regressed, never re-propose
a change already shown to hurt or to fail, and state how this round is expected
to improve on the best.
